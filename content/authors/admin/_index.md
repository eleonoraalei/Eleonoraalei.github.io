I am currently a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD. My most recent position was as a postdoctoral researcher in the Exoplanet & Habitability Group at ETH Zurich. <br>I study the atmospheric structure and the detectability of habitable terrestrial planets with next-generation space telescopes. I use Bayesian retrieval frameworks to define the science requirements of the LIFE (Large Interferometer For Exoplanet) and the HWO (Habitable Worlds Observatory) concepts. I am the main developer of Exo-MerCat, a catalog of exoplanet data with the most precise and accurate measurements taken from the main exoplanet catalogs. I also co-developed the open-source code petitRADTRANS for the calculation of exoplanetary spectra.
